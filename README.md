# Twitter-NLP

Tweet data available on Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rsloot/twitter-trendstweet-for-october-2017">here</a>

Run notebooks after downloading dataset. Used various nlp methods to analyse the tweets from simpler word associations to sentiment analysis with vader.
The dataset is from October 2017, but the code in this repo could be used to pull from twitter for however long you want, provided you have/get an API user key.
The .py files will provide code for pulling and storing tweets. Default is set to pull every 4 minutes until canceled, or the start of a new month.
